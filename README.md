# Soccer

This my byteworks interview assessment project for the Front-End Developer role

## Description

Soccer is a web application built in angular that consumes web APIs to provide information about soccer competitions, players and teams.
- The project took me days to start and complete, because i saw the Task email very late

- The most difficulty i faced was getting the player's thumbnail, because the api given does not provide any, so i had to use the wikipedia api to query the player's page and grab their thubmnail from there. I also had to use the http.jsonp method instead of the http.get, because of the Cross Origin Resource Sharing(CORS) error i was recieving from the wikipeia API call.
 

- The functionality i'm most proud of is the pagination i implemented in the squad list page, because i didn't utilize any libraries just raw code! and i'm also proud of the theming of the entire project 

## Liberies Used

- Bootstrap was used for as my css framework, because it is responsive right out of the box and has alot of built in style classes

- jQuery was used to suppport the bootstrap framework, as it is required

## Issues

- My commit history was lost due to an error on my end while uploading the project

## Some Screenshots
- The rest of the screenshots can be found in the screenshots folder in the root directory
